/**
ðŸ§  What's a Reducer?
A reducer is just a function that:

Takes in the current state.

Takes in an action (which says what we want to do).

Returns a new state based on the action.

Reducers are used with useReducer (or Redux) to update state in a structured and predictable way.

ðŸ§© Let's explain each part of your code:
ðŸ”¹ export default (state, action) => { ... }
This is an arrow function being exported as the default function from the file.

It will be imported and used in your GlobalProvider with useReducer.

It takes in two arguments:

state: the current state (e.g., your transactions list).

action: an object that tells the reducer what to do (e.g., add or delete something).

ðŸ”¹ switch(action.type) { ... }
action.type is the type of action we want to perform.

switch is like an if-else ladder â€” we check the value of action.type, and handle it.

Right now, there's only one case:

js
Copy
Edit
default:
    return state;
This means: if no matching action type is found, just return the current state unchanged.

ðŸ“¦ So what does this reducer do now?
ðŸ‘‰ Nothing yet â€“ it just returns the existing state no matter what.
